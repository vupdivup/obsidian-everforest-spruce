**Everforest Spruce** is an Obsidian theme based on [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) by [Sainnhe Park](https://github.com/sainnhe), created as a decluttered alternative to existing variations. It aims to be minimalistic while guiding focus to important text sections via the palette's accent colors.
