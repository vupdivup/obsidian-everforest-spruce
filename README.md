# Everforest Spruce

![Everforest Spruce](docs/images/screenshot.png)

**Everforest Spruce** is an Obsidian theme based on [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) by [Sainnhe Park](https://github.com/sainnhe), created as a decluttered alternative to existing variations. It aims to be minimalistic while guiding focus to important text sections via the palette's accent colors.

> Everforest Spruce is currently **dark-mode only**.

- Pleasant and subtle Everforest color scheme
- Visual separation through colored elements
- Reduced eye strain via a dimmed background
- Sleek mono-color headings
