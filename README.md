# Everforest Spruce

![Everforest Spruce](docs/images/screenshot.png)

**Everforest Spruce** is an Obsidian theme based on [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) by [Sainnhe Park](https://github.com/sainnhe), created as a decluttered alternative to existing variations. It aims to be minimalistic while guiding focus to important text sections via the palette's accent colors.

This theme is currently **dark-mode only**. It uses Everforest's medium-contrast color scheme, with a dimmed background to reduce eye strain. Classic markdown elements like bolds, italics, lists and blockquotes are emphasized through subtle colored highlights.
